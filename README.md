# Discord-Sound-Board-Bot

I'll write here my own discord bot to work as a sound board.
It will use mostly CLI commands and maybe some chat message commands.
Let's see where it goes.
And I'll do it for Linux only, but with an easy way to port it to windows if you want to do this yourslef.

## Notice that I'll use this repo to learn the discord.py module. Please don't expect it to work as intended in the near future. It will be done, when it will be done.
